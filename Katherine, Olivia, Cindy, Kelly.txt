Rules should have a composition arrow to Deck.
Deck should have a composition arrow to Card
Computer should have a composition arrow to Deck.
I'm not sure how game has a relationship to Rules (I think honestly Rules should be the game though).
Your rules class has a lot of methods that seem unnecessary and should be on the Cards themselves as an effect.
Also there does not seem to be any methods that have to do with uno flip variation (back of cards, flipping hand etc.)
